<p><strong>Part 1:&nbsp;</strong>Start with this page: <a href="http://bit.ly/2yBYxX3">http://bit.ly/2yBYxX3</a></p>
<p>Add JQuery to hide each &lt;li&gt; element individually when they are clicked on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Click on one &lt;li&gt;, that &lt;li&gt; should hide, not all of them</p>
<p>Add JQuery to hide every &lt;b&gt; element when any &lt;b&gt; element is clicked on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Clicking any &lt;b&gt; should make all &lt;b&gt; elements hide</p>
<p>Extra challenge: can you make them fade away instead of immediately disappearing when clicked? (hint: see first example in the slides)</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><strong>: </strong>Start with this page <a href="http://bit.ly/2y3Sw8L">http://bit.ly/2y3Sw8L</a></p>
<p>Add a click listener to all elements with class=place</p>
<p>When these elements are clicked, add the class="visited". The CSS provided will style class=visited elements with strikethrough text and grey background. You</p>
<p>can either add the visited class, or use toggleClass so user can un-vist somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the .length property to keep the count of visited and not visited places up to date when the page loads, and as the user changes the number of visited places.</p>
<p>Display an alert when the user has visited all of the places</p>
<p><strong>Part 3:</strong>&nbsp;Use this sample web page. <a href="https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week5-jquery-examples/blob/master/lab-5-q1.html" target="_blank">https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week5-jquery-examples/blob/master/lab-5-q1.html</a></p>
<p>Use JQuery selectors to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the page loads, make the &lt;span&gt; elements bold &nbsp;</li>
<li>When the &lt;h2&gt; elements are clicked on, give them a green background (or another color of your choice)</li>
<li>Make the&nbsp;&lt;p&gt; elements disappear when you hover over them with the mouse. They should appear when the mouse moves away.</li>
<li>When the id="h1_blue" button is clicked, make all of the H1 elements blue. (or another color of your choice)</li>
<li>When the id="remove_not_important" button is clicked, remove the li items with class = "not_important"</li>
<li>When the items in the unordered list are clicked, make them slide away or fade out. Each item should fade individually - so if you click on the 3rd item, only the 3rd item should fade. The items in the ordered list should not slide away/fade out when clicked.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part 1: To Do list in JQuery</strong></p>
<p>Create a web page with an empty list, and an input box. You will use this to create a to do list. When you type something in the input box, it will be added to the to do list. &nbsp;Make sure you don't add empty items to the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decide on one style to represent items that are not done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Decide on another style to represent items that you have done; which will be list elements with the 'done' class. &nbsp;For example, you could use&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">text-decoration: line-through</span><span><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">;</span> &nbsp;to put a line through the text. Or, another style of your choice.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p>Create a CSS stylesheet with one style for regular list items, and a different style for list items with the class 'done'.</p>
<p>When you click on one of your&nbsp;list items, it should toggle between done and not done. You should use the toggleClass method to add or remove the 'done' class; so that the appropriate CSS style is applied.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong></p>
<p>Add a button to remove the items you have done. When you click the button, all of the list items that have the class 'done' will be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: To Do List, move&nbsp;done items:</strong></p>
<p>Modify so that when you click the remove button, remove this list item (or items); and add a row to a table on the same page. The new row will have the text of the item in one column, and the date that you marked it done in the second column. &nbsp;Make sure you don't re-add items to the table when you click the button multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: To Do List Animation:</strong></p>
<p>Use the fade, or slide, or animate functions to animate the list items being deleted from the list and being added to the table.</p>
